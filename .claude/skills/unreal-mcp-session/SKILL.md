description: START HERE for any Unreal work on Pool Hop. The orientation layer — how to connect to the running editor via the unreal-mcp server (and what to do when it's NOT connected), discover and call tools, verify work against COLD ON-DISK state (not dirty editor memory), run and observe the game two different ways (MCP Play-In-Editor vs. the standalone + real-input probe), and the safety rules. Read this before the three domain skills (unreal-mcp-blueprints, unreal-mcp-scene-building, unreal-input-probe).

# Unreal MCP — Session Orientation (read first)

This is the map. The territory is in three domain skills: **[unreal-mcp-blueprints](../unreal-mcp-blueprints/SKILL.md)** (Blueprint graphs/classes/variables/DSL), **[unreal-mcp-scene-building](../unreal-mcp-scene-building/SKILL.md)** (levels/actors/materials/PIE/screenshots), **[unreal-input-probe](../unreal-input-probe/SKILL.md)** (self-testing real keyboard/mouse input). Load the domain skill for the task; this file tells you how to get connected, how to trust your work, and how to see the game.

## 1. Connecting — the one gotcha that wastes whole sessions

**The unreal-mcp server attaches to Claude Code ONCE, at Claude-session start.** There is **no in-session reconnect**. Consequences:

- The editor must **already be running with the MCP server started** *before* you launch Claude. If it wasn't, `ToolSearch` for unreal tools returns **nothing for the entire session** — and relaunching the editor mid-session does **not** help.
- If you find yourself with no unreal tools: (1) make sure the editor is up with the server (command below), (2) confirm port 8000 is listening, then (3) **restart Claude Code** — the fresh session hooks into the running server. Project state survives via git + the `CLAUDE.md` handoff note, so this is cheap.

**Server facts (not documented in the domain skills — anchor them here):**
- Transport: HTTP MCP on **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`** (port **8000**). No auth — localhost is not a trust boundary; never expose the port.
- The editor does **not** auto-start the server. The `-ExecCmds` arg does. **Start editor + server:**
  ```powershell
  Get-Process UnrealEditor,CrashReportClientEditor -EA SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force; Start-Sleep 5;
  Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.8\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe" -ArgumentList @("C:\Users\jackw\Desktop\PoolHop\PoolHop.uproject","-ExecCmds=ModelContextProtocol.StartServer")
  ```
- **Verify ready:** poll `Test-NetConnection 127.0.0.1 -Port 8000` until `TcpTestSucceeded=True`. Boot takes ~1–3 min (shader/asset load). A **"Restore Packages" modal on boot blocks the MCP game thread** — if you force-killed the editor, delete `Saved/Autosaves/PackageRestoreData.json` before relaunching, or the next agent's MCP calls hang behind the modal.
- Requires the `ModelContextProtocol` **and** `AllToolsets` plugins enabled (they are, in `PoolHop.uproject`). Without AllToolsets the server exposes zero tools.

## 2. Discovering & calling tools

Unreal tools are **deferred** — their schemas aren't loaded until you fetch them. Load in bulk:
```
ToolSearch  "select:mcp__unreal-mcp__call_tool"       # the main entry point
ToolSearch  "unreal blueprint"                          # keyword search across the server
```
Almost everything routes through **`mcp__unreal-mcp__call_tool`** with `toolset_name` + `tool_name` + args. The foundational toolsets:

| Toolset | For |
|---|---|
| `editor_toolset.toolsets.blueprint.BlueprintTools` | create BPs, variables, functions, events, `write_graph_dsl`, `compile_blueprint` |
| `SceneTools` / `ActorTools` / `PrimitiveTools` | levels, place/transform actors, `trace_world`, tags |
| `ObjectTools` | `get_properties` / `set_properties` (CDO defaults, component props) — **`values` is a JSON-encoded STRING** |
| `MaterialTools` | create/edit materials, expressions, recompile |
| `EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset` | camera, `CaptureViewport` / `CaptureEditorImage`, `StartPIE` / `IsPIERunning` / `StopPIE` |
| `DataAssetTools` / `DataTableTools` | PrimaryDataAssets, Data Tables |

**Schema loading:** `describe_toolset("...BlueprintTools")` is ~72k chars and overflows the tool-result limit → it spills to a `tool-results/*.txt` file. Parse it with Python (`json.load`, extract the tool objects by short name) rather than reading it whole. Before your first `write_graph_dsl`, call `get_graph_dsl_docs()` — the DSL grammar is not inlined anywhere; that tool is the reference.

## 3. The verification discipline — trust disk, not the editor

**This is the rule that would have saved days.** The "game ignores all input" bug (2026-07-01, `Docs/LESSONS.md`) was IMC assets that MCP saved with **empty Mappings arrays** — the bindings existed only in that editor session's memory. Every in-editor "verified" test passed against dirty RAM; every cold load from disk had nothing.

- **After any asset work:** `AssetTools.save_assets([])` → `find Content -name "*.uasset" -size 0` (catch the 0-byte silent-corruption class) → `compile_blueprint(warnings_as_errors=true)` on every touched BP (a non-compiling BP freezes PIE on a modal MCP can't dismiss).
- **`save_assets` can silently no-op** on corrupted stub packages (returns success, writes nothing). If a file stays 0-byte, `AssetTools.delete` the stub and re-create it fresh.
- **String-grepping a `.uasset` proves a *reference* exists, NOT that an array has *elements*.** `grep -ac IA_Move IMC.uasset` returning >0 means only that the import table names it.
- **Only a FRESH PROCESS tests on-disk truth.** PIE right after authoring exercises in-memory objects. The honest test of "did it actually save correctly" is: restart the editor, or launch the game standalone (§4b), then read the state back. Make this reflex for anything load-bearing (input assets, CDO defaults, replication).
- **`read_graph_dsl` lies** about freshly-rewired nodes and cannot traverse Enhanced Input `Triggered`/`Started` exec pins (renders them empty). Trust `get_node_infos` (pin-level) + a clean compile, never the DSL round-trip, for input wiring.

## 4. Running & observing the game — two channels, pick deliberately

### (a) MCP Play-In-Editor — fast, but input-blind
`EditorAppToolset.StartPIE(options={bSimulate:false, playMode:"PlayMode_InViewPort", warmupSeconds:1})` → `IsPIERunning()` → inspect → `StopPIE()`. Good for: spawn/possession/GameMode-load verification, reading replicated state, `CaptureEditorImage`. **Cannot inject player input** (Enhanced Input ignores synthetic Slate keys), so it can't feel-test verbs. Prove movement without input via a temporary `EventTick → AddMovementInput` probe, then delete it. Measure fps by a **<1 s** frame-counter delta or a frame-to-frame pixel diff — never a long-gap counter read (it wraps at 1000). The in-viewport window throttles to a few fps when it loses OS focus; that's not a perf bug.

### (b) Standalone + real OS input — the self-test channel (NEW, no MCP needed)
The long-standing "only a human can press W" wall is **broken**: **PowerShell `SendInput` drives Enhanced Input end-to-end** (real hardware-path input), and **GDI `CopyFromScreen` captures the game window** (computer-use can't). This works even with the MCP disconnected. Full recipe + scripts: **[unreal-input-probe](../unreal-input-probe/SKILL.md)**. Use it to:
- Self-verify movement/jump/interact after any input or character change (WASD, mouse-look, Space — all injectable + screenshot-able).
- Drive the **in-game tilde `~` console** (open with VK `0xC0`, type command as VKs, Enter) — this is the "menu" that reads runtime truth:
  - `showdebug enhancedinput` → on-screen: possessed pawn/controller, input mode, **applied mapping contexts + live action values** ("No enhanced player input action mappings have been applied" = empty/missing contexts).
  - `GetAll <Class> <Property>` → dumps any UObject property of all instances to `Saved/Logs/PoolHop.log` (e.g. `GetAll InputMappingContext Mappings` = read asset content at runtime).
- **Warn the user first** — it moves their real mouse/keyboard for ~10 s.

Standalone launch: `UnrealEditor.exe <proj> -game -windowed -ResX=1280 -ResY=720 -WinX=80 -WinY=80 -NoSplash`. It does **not** exit on focus loss (old myth). Find its window by **PID** (title `PoolHop (64-bit Development PCD3D_SM6)`), focus by real click.

## 5. Safety (Epic's rules — non-negotiable)

- **Commit before starting and after each chunk.** MCP mutates/deletes live VCS-tracked assets in one call. Origin `https://github.com/Swjsh/Pool-Hop-prj` (main), Git LFS for binaries.
- **Never `--dangerously-skip-permissions`** while the plugin is loaded — it removes the per-tool approval gate.
- **`execute_tool_script` runs arbitrary editor Python** with full disk access — treat every call as privileged; review the diff. (It also can't `import unreal` — only stdlib + `execute_tool()`.)
- The MCP is **Experimental** — expect API drift; don't build load-bearing automation on unstable tool signatures.

## 6. What MCP CANNOT build (hard ceiling — plan around it)

Spiked + confirmed (`Docs/LESSONS.md`, `Docs/design/CANON.md` §"Known MCP buildability gaps"). MCP **cannot** create: **Blueprint Enums/Structs**, **Run-on-Server/Reliable RPC flags**, **Behavior Trees/Blackboards**, **UMG widget trees**, and (unconfirmed) Niagara/EQS. Interim substitutes are canon: enums → `byte`, `Server_*` RPCs → regular `HasAuthority`-guarded functions, BT/HUD → **needs the user in-editor** (leave a click-by-click checklist). computer-use also can't reach the editor window here, so there's no GUI-automation fallback for these — they genuinely need the human.
